This is an example package for using illstack in the CAMELS Binder environment. It is a simplified version of the whole illstack package to be more user-friendly to this specific application.

Clone illstack normally from Github, but we will only use the scripts in subdirectory illstack/illstack (init.py,cyprof.pyx, etc.) along with the scripts in this example.

My organization on Binder is as follows:

Foundation scripts-
/home/jovyan/home/illstack/illstack/

Example scripts-
/home/jovyan/home/illstack/CAMELS_example/
